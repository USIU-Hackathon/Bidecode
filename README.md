Over the last few years and months in Kenya, several emergencies have increased among them being The westgate saga, Garissa Attack, some grenade bombings, militia attacks in Rift Valley, Eastern and North Eastern Kenya. People end up injured some of whom receive medical attention to late or lack means of communication to relatives. The challenge has been the “How” in communication to call for help with the location.

Jisalimu is an Emergency application and response Software that combines Mobile Application (ie, Android and Windows Phone), a USSD Application and a Dashboard where all new requests, historical records can be accessed in real time.
